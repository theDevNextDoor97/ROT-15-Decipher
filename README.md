# ROT-15-Decipher
Just something i did for an assignment way back. 
Feel free to use it how you please
Instructions where are follows:


•	Candidates will be able to fetch data from an API using the JavaScript fetch API and display the information on the webpage.
•	Candidates will be able to make use of the Flex and Grid layouts for clean and responsive user interfaces.



Project Outline:

The aim of this project is for candidates to create a web interface that ciphers and deciphers code.

The cipher must use the 15th letter after the letter that you want to use and it is cyclical e.g., 'a' encodes 'p' and 'p' encodes to 'e' because (the 10th letter after ‘p’ is ‘z’), so 5 letters after that will be ‘e’ because the cycle starts again).

Create an interface that will encode any message you give it and decode any encrypted message you give it. Print out the encoded/decoded message in the UI.

A few things to note:
•	You may not simply create an array of the alphabet!
•	You may need to do some research on how to turn a letter into a number.
•	Be aware of what happens with capital versus lower case letters.
•	You need to account for this.
•	Spaces and punctuation marks need to stay the same when encoded. So, a space will remain a space, a full stop will remain a full stop, etc.
